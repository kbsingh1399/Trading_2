Thought Process

I'll install the four repositories into the project workspace and set up a registry so they can be referenced in every subsequent reply. Starting with the clones:

Ran 1 commands

All four cloned. Now inventorying their contents:

Explored 1 files，Ran 1 commands

All four repos are in place with a large skills payload. Let me get exact counts and build the persistent registry:

Ran 1 commands

~494 skills installed across the four libraries. Now writing the persistent registry that makes them loadable in every future reply:

Wrote 2 files
Create File INDEX.md
Edit File worklog.md
Done

✅ All four libraries installed at /home/z/my-project/external-skills/:

REPO
	
PAYLOAD

addyosmani/agent-skills	25 engineering skills (planning, TDD, debugging, security, shipping…)
Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps	11 agent skills + 100+ runnable LLM app examples (RAG, multi-agent, voice, MCP)
affaan-m/ECC	443 skills (311 canonical + 132 core) — frameworks, ops, security, llm-trading-agent-security, deep-research…
obra/superpowers	15 process skills (brainstorming, plans, systematic-debugging, verification-before-completion…)

≈ 494 skills total. I've written a registry at external-skills/INDEX.md containing the standing reply protocol you asked for: every subsequent reply will (1) check the routing table, (2) actually load the matched SKILL.md files, and (3) close with a Skills applied: footer — or state why none applied. Safety rules are baked in: your council SOP and platform rules stay authoritative; third-party skill bodies are treated as untrusted guidance (no blind shell/credential execution).

Next steps you might want: ① I can map the quant-council workflow specifically (Cycle dispatch → llm-trading-agent-security + verification-loop + continuous-learning); ② refresh anytime via git pull --depth 1; ③ point me at your next task and the footer protocol kicks in immediately.

Skills applied: none — this was the installation/registry turn; the protocol governs all future replies.
